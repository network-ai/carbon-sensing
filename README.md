# Carbon Sensing Platform

An AI-powered platform that automatically measures carbon stocks and monitors land use changes using satellite imagery. We use remote sensing and artificial intelligence to track deforestation, verify carbon credits, and calculate carbon storage without manual field work. The system analyzes satellite data in real-time to detect land use changes, while large language models (LLMs) generate automated environmental reports and insights. Perfect for carbon credit verification, environmental monitoring, and investment risk assessment.
